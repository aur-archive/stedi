Conditions for the use of FORM 




The use of the FORM program and programs in the distribution is free of charge but subject to the following conditions:

The programs are `as is'. That is, neither the author(s) nor his/their employer(s) is/are to be held responsible in any way for any errors or malfunctioning of the programs.
The programs are not to be redistributed in any version that is modified from the original distribution version unless with the specific consent of the author. In particular this license file is to be part of any redistribution.
The programs are not to be redistributed in exchange for money or made part of any commercial deal without the explicit written consent of the author.
When the FORM program is used for scientific work that leads to publication in a scientific journal, this work should refer to the use of FORM by the following citation: J.A.M.Vermaseren "New features of FORM" math-ph/0010025 or something similar that is acceptable for the journal of publication.


Some remarks:

ad 1: It is always wise to make cross checks on your calculations. It is virtually impossible to make more than 2 Mbytes of code without errors. If you do believe that you ran into an error, please try to make a bug report and try to keep it as concise as possible. Send bug reports to form@nikhef.nl.spam (please strip the .spam).

ad 2: It is to nobodies advantage if different versions of programs start floating around. If someone has a sensible modification of any of the programs, please send it to form@nikhef.nl.spam (please strip the .spam). If possible the author(s) will then include this modification in the distribution (with mentioning the source of it).

ad 3: If somebody is going to earn money by distributing FORM or making it part of a commercial product, maybe it is not a bad idea to not forget the author(s). This could even help in the service department.

ad 4: NIKHEF, my home institute and FOM, its granting agency have allowed me to spend enormous amounts of time on the making and improving of FORM. At the same time, one of the ways they measure `productivity' is by citations. It would be nice to show them something for all this work. 

More remarks: If you do not agree with the above conditions, you have two options:

You do not use FORM and the other programs included in the distribution.
You let the author(s) know about reasonable improvements of the above conditions. If they are mutually acceptable, you might still be allowed to use the programs.
